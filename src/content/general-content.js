		"Hey there, good to have you here! I'm Giuseppe Di Guglielmo, your friendly neighborhood web developer from Zurich. Since I spend most of my time in a German-speaking region, I thought it would be hilarious to embrace my German alter ego. So, welcome to my website, and let's embark on this web development adventure together with a dash of Von Wilhelm.",
	// homeAbout:
	// 	"Grüezi, I'm a coding enthusiast who has been immersed in the world of programming since April 2020. Before diving into the realm of coding, I spent a whopping 15 years working in the architecture sector, where I honed my eye for detail and developed a deep appreciation for design. <br><br> However, my true passion lies in the world of coding, particularly frontend development. I find immense joy in crafting beautiful and interactive user interfaces that could leave a lasting impact. For nearly two years, I ventured into the realm of self-employment as a web developer, where I had the opportunity to explore diverse projects and further refine my skills. <br><br> Currently working as a software developer at <a href='https://learning.constructor.org'> Constructor Learning </a>, a company that specializes in offering bootcamps in web development. This role allows me to combine my love for coding with my desire to help others learn and grow.<br><br> In a nutshell, from transitioning out of architecture to pursuing my passion for frontend development, my journey has been a thrilling one. I'm excited about the possibilities that coding brings and eager to continue pushing boundaries, creating exceptional digital experiences, and making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.",
